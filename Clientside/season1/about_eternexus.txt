Eternexus can not extract-repack season1 because of non latin characters (Client will not load).
That is nothing to do with this release.

If you having hard time to extract-repack season1 then check my comment here:

If you are using other extractor what are capable to extract-repack non latin characters then you can ignore this notice.
